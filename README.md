# Flash Chat : Flutter demo app using Firebase Firestore.

## Not included the google-services.json file. You will have to create your project on firebase console and include the created google-services.json file for Android app.

Add your project on Firebase from https://console.firebase.google.com

## Our Goal
This demo is based on the step by step learning that I have done through online course from London App Brewery Flutter bootcamp.

The objective of this demo app is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.

## How we will proceed and implement below widgets:

- Incorporate Firebase into your Flutter projects.
- Firebase authentication to register and sign in users.
- Create beautiful animations using the Flutter Hero widget.
- Create custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller. 
- Mixins and how they differ from superclasses.
- Streams and how they work.
- ListViews to build scrolling views.
- Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve data on the fly.
